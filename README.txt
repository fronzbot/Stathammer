Stathammer is in no way afiliated with Games Workshop.  This
tool uses basic statistical principles to calculate probabilities
based on stats input by the user.  These stats are availaible by
purchasing the approriate rulebooks and codices from http://games-workshop.com

This program is currently in its alpha phase which means there's
still a heck of a lot to go.  For any feature suggestions/bug reports
please send an email to Kevin at kfronczak@gmail.com.  The program
is still very malleable so if you have any features you'd like to see,
this would be the most oppurtune time to ask!
